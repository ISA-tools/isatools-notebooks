    "\n",
    "*Male Fisher F344 rats* purchased from Charles River were treated with *3 commonly used painkillers*, namely *acetylsalicilic acid, acetaminophen and ibuprofen*, at *2 distinct dose levels*, delivered *per os*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal number of animals (n=5) were allocated to each of the group defined by a *compound, dose level and duration post exposure* (of 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours) combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following sacrifice performed by cervical dislocation and exsanguination preceded by anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine solution), *blood and kidney specimens were collected*.\n",
    "Total RNA were extracted from kidney samples and mRNA sequencing (*transcription profiling*) was performed using paired-end libraries on Illumina sequencing platform using an *Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Blood samples* were collected at sacrifice time and immediately placed in precooled 60 percent methanol ammonium bicarbonate buffer to quench cellular metabolism. Blood Metabolites were separated in water-soluble and lipophilic fractions. \n",
    "*Metabolite profiling* was performed on the polar metabolite fraction only, using *flow injection analysis (FIA) mass spectrometry* on an *Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF Mass Sprectrometry platform*. Each fraction was injected twice and data were acquired in both ionization modes (positive mode and negative mode).\n",
    "Raw data files were saved in native instrument format and later converted to HUPO-PSI standard format for mass spectrometry.\n"
